CVE-2007-4559

Implement parts of PEP 706 Filter for tarfile.extractall

ExFileObject now acts as a context manager.
The list method of TarFile now has the "members" parameter

Various tests were added to check for proper behaviour with SymLinks

Python2 doesn't have pathlib, so those tests are disabled
